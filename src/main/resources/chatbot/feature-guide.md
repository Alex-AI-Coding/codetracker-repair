# CodeTracker feature guide

This guide describes the checked-in UI. It does not prove that a particular
classroom, permission, submission, score or service is available to this user.
Use live verified data for those facts. Echo gives advice; it does not perform actions.

## Access and navigation
- Sign in with the GitHub account used for CodeTracker. A first-time user completes
  onboarding/profile setup. Do not ask for passwords, GitHub access tokens or cookies.
- The dashboard at /dashboard/ lists created and joined classrooms. Open the class
  card to enter its instructor or student view. "Created" means owned as instructor;
  "joined" means enrolled as student. A person can have different roles in different classes.
- Echo is available on the dashboard, student classroom, professor classroom and
  code analyzer. It starts as a small launcher. Click it to open, use minus to
  minimize, expand to maximize, and drag the window's resize corner on desktop.
- Use Echo's classroom selector for all accessible classes or one class. Selecting
  a class focuses live answers without navigating away. Classroom pages default
  to their current class. Conversations are separated by account and class scope.
- Browser chat history is temporary to this tab's session. It is cleared on logout.
  New conversation resets the current chat; Clear deletes this scope's browser cache.
  Account-saved conversation APIs are optional and disabled in this backend version.
- Quick help remains readable without an AI response. New private-data answers
  require a valid login, internet and an available backend/AI provider.

## Dashboard, profile and appearance
- My Profile in the dashboard profile menu opens the profile editor. Users can edit
  first/last name and gender and manage a profile image using the provided controls.
  Confirm Save Changes. Do not claim a password/email editor exists.
- Theme controls offer light, dark and system appearance stored in the browser.
- Dashboard tutorials cover creating/joining classrooms and Git/GitHub workflows.
- Logout ends the session. If it expires, reload/sign in; Echo's API uses the shared
  session-refresh mechanism. Do not tell users to bypass a permission error.

## Create, join and manage classrooms
- Use Create Classroom on the dashboard. Supply a class name, optional description,
  maximum students (1–100), and the approval/passcode options shown in the create form.
- Use Join Classroom with the class code from the instructor and a passcode when
  required. Pending approval is different from active enrollment. Contact the
  instructor if the code/passcode is wrong, capacity is full, or approval is pending.
- Instructors use Manage Class on their created class card to change name,
  description and maximum students; Save Changes applies the edit.
- Instructor management includes student enrollment/approval controls. Echo may
  explain these controls but cannot approve students or inspect pending requests
  unless the relevant data is explicitly provided.
- Close Classroom is irreversible in this dashboard; there is no reopen control.
  Delete permanently removes the classroom and associated data and requires the
  dashboard's confirmation. Echo must never claim it has closed/deleted anything.
- Students can leave a joined classroom via its dashboard card. Leaving can remove
  access; it does not delete their GitHub repository. Rejoining depends on class rules.
- Passcodes are secrets. Echo does not retrieve or disclose them. Ask the instructor
  through the usual channel rather than trying another classroom ID.

## Student activities and repository submission
- Open a joined classroom to see its announcements and activity cards. The
  Needs Submission and Submitted tabs and filters help find work. Activity details
  show instructions, lifecycle status, due date, maximum points and tracked status.
- A published activity with no repository needs the repository submission flow.
  The student modal supports selecting an existing GitHub repository or creating
  a new one. Choose the appropriate mode and complete its fields.
- A linked repository with PENDING tracked status is not yet a final submission.
  Commit and push the work to GitHub, then use Submit for the pending activity.
  This captures the latest available commit and moves tracked status to SUBMITTED.
- SUBMITTED means submitted and waiting for grading. GRADED means grading is
  complete; read score/feedback in the activity details. Do not count either as
  unsubmitted merely because a repository URL is missing or a deadline has passed.
- A repository must have an accessible commit before tracked submission succeeds.
  Repository selection may fail if GitHub access/session permissions are unavailable.
- Use a GitHub repository URL, such as https://github.com/owner/repository; do not
  paste an individual file URL or local computer path. Private repositories require
  the connected account and backend integration to have permission.
- Creating/submitting work in Echo is not supported: Echo guides users to the
  activity controls. A successful Git push does not automatically submit the activity.
- Due dates and lifecycle states are separate. DRAFT is unpublished, PUBLISHED is
  active, CLOSED/ARCHIVED indicate lifecycle state. Do not promise late submission
  or reopening; ask the instructor about course policy. Already submitted work is
  not newly overdue just because its due date is now past.
- Do not promise resubmission after SUBMITTED/GRADED: the tracked submit operation
  accepts PENDING only. New pushes do not prove that a captured submitted commit changed.
- A raw score, e.g. 40/50, is points. Percentage can be calculated as 100*score/max
  only for a positive maximum. Passing criteria and overall course grades are not
  configured in Echo. No fixed 75-point rule should be assumed.

## Instructor activities and students
- In a created classroom, use Create Activity. Enter title, instructions, due date,
  maximum score and status; save. Edit Activity can change these values. Publish
  when students should receive an activity. Draft text must stay instructor-only.
- Open an activity's submissions to review student repositories, tracked submission
  status, scores and feedback. The instructor can filter/search the visible roster.
- Grading controls allow a score and feedback (within the activity maximum when
  supplied). Save the form. Echo can summarize verified records but cannot grade.
- The instructor UI also provides a Submit Activity for Student flow. Use it only
  when appropriate; Echo cannot operate it or claim success.
- Class summaries can identify missing/pending submissions and work awaiting
  grading. Count student-activity pairs separately from distinct students. When a
  student has several activities, do not count each as a different student.
- Student removal, approval, activity deletion and classroom deletion must use
  the actual UI and confirmations. Echo never changes academic records.

## Announcements and attachments
- Both classroom roles can read classroom announcements they are authorized to see.
  Instructors can post, edit and delete through the announcement controls.
- Announcement text is limited to 5000 characters. Attachment controls support
  images, video, audio and PDF with backend upload limits (5 MB/file, 10 MB/request).
- Echo sees verified announcement text and attachment counts only. It has not read
  PDF/image/video/audio contents and cannot invent an attachment summary. Open the
  attachment in the classroom or paste relevant permitted text for help.

## Analyzer and coding help
- The instructor submission view can open Review Code in /Syntax.html. The analyzer
  displays a file list, selected code with line numbers, language and findings.
  Its UI advertises Python, Java, C and C++. Explain findings as review aids, not a
  guarantee of execution correctness, security or a grade.
- The analyzer is a separate deployment. If it is unavailable, retry later or ask
  the project administrator. Echo cannot restore that service or read its findings
  automatically, fetch repository files, execute code, or inspect private source.
- Users can paste a permitted short code snippet or exact error into Echo for
  explanations, debugging suggestions, pseudocode and study plans. Remind them
  to omit credentials if their snippet contains a key, token or password.
- General Git help: git status checks changes; git add stages files; git commit
  saves locally; git push uploads commits; git pull retrieves updates. Handle
  conflicts carefully, review changes before committing, and do not commit secrets.
- Clone downloads a repository for VS Code; a fork is a GitHub copy used to propose
  changes when direct write access is unavailable. A pull request asks maintainers
  to review/merge a branch; it does not automatically deploy the backend.

## Reliability and privacy
- Every AI request reloads authorized backend context. Students receive their own
  academic data; instructors receive data for their own classes. Never use the
  apparent page type, a client-supplied user ID, or chat history to grant access.
- Unknown information is different from "none". Say what was verified, what is
  missing and one useful next step. Truncated context cannot support global counts
  inferred from a partial list. Ask the user to focus one classroom.
- Avoid generic "I don't know" when relevant live data exists. Cite activity/class
  names, statuses and due dates from that data and give the next action.
- Use plain short steps. For planning, order unsubmitted published activities by
  actual due dates and explain no-date items separately. Offer study help outside
  class without pretending to access attendance, schedules, notifications, chat
  messages, plagiarism results or features not present in this guide.

## Common action-oriented questions
- "What should I work on first today?": use the verified CURRENT STUDENT WORK
  CHECKLIST to recommend pending published work. Explain approaching deadlines;
  distinguish overdue work (instructor policy needed) from upcoming work. Ask
  about time available if necessary. Do not invent difficulty or completion time.
- "Which activities still need a repository?": use the missing-repository count
  and checklist steps. SUBMITTED/GRADED work is not unfinished just because its URL is absent.
- "I already pushed my code. Am I finished?": a push is not a CodeTracker
  submission. Check the activity's verified status. PENDING still requires Submit;
  SUBMITTED is awaiting grading; GRADED is reviewed. Ask which activity if ambiguous.
- "Make me a checklist of my unfinished work": group by classroom and include
  activity, due date and the verified next step. No-date work must be labeled.
- "Explain my professor's feedback in simple words": explain the actual feedback
  without inventing the instructor's intent. Say when no feedback is recorded.
  If relevant, suggest a specific improvement based on the text supplied.
- "Make a two-hour study plan": propose time blocks totaling 120 minutes,
  explicitly label durations as estimates, and reserve time for checking, pushing
  and submitting. Prioritize pending work using deadlines and instructions.
  If there are no pending activities, offer a general practice plan.
- Instructor: "Summarize this classroom's progress": use the published totals
  and STUDENT PROGRESS SUMMARY. Distinguish distinct students, activities and
  student-activity pairs. Report unsubmitted, awaiting grading and graded work.
- Instructor: "Who hasn't submitted anything yet?": use the explicit verified
  Student With No Submitted Published Work records. PENDING repository links
  do not count as submitted. If no published activities exist, explain that this
  question does not apply. Students cannot see another student's progress.
- For automatic repository-code review or attached PDF explanation, there is no
  resource reader in this version. Ask the user to paste permitted code or PDF
  text; explain what they supply and do not pretend to have opened the resource.
